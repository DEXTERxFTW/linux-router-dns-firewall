# Linux-Based Wireless Router with Custom DNS & Firewall

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates how an **old laptop** was converted into a fully functional **Linux-based Wi-Fi Access Point** with a **custom DNS server** and **firewall rules**.  
Since the **inbuilt Wi-Fi card of the laptop was not working**, we connected an **external USB Wi-Fi adapter (Realtek RTL8188FTV)** to enable wireless access point functionality.  
It was built on **Ubuntu Server (CLI-only)** and includes step-by-step configuration of **network drivers, DHCP, Hostapd, Dnsmasq, and Iptables firewall**.
The aim was to repurpose legacy hardware into a **secure and educational networking appliance**, gaining hands-on experience with system administration, networking, and troubleshooting.

##  Features
- Wireless Access Point using **Hostapd**
- DHCP & DNS services with **Dnsmasq**
- Custom **DNS blocking & redirection**
- **Firewall & NAT** setup using Iptables
- Logs of **errors and troubleshooting**
- Repurposed old hardware into a **working router**

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (CLI-only)**
- **Hostapd** â€“ Wireless Access Point service
- **Dnsmasq** â€“ Lightweight DNS & DHCP server
- **Iptables** â€“ Firewall and NAT
- **Systemd / Netplan** â€“ Network configuration

---

##  Setup Process (Simplified)
1. Installed Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (CLI)  
2. Resolved **ethernet driver issues** and installed missing packages  
3. Installed and configured `hostapd` for Wi-Fi AP  
4. Configured `dnsmasq` for DHCP + custom DNS  
5. Applied **iptables firewall rules** for NAT and traffic filtering  
6. Documented troubleshooting for errors like:  
   - *"Failed to connect to bus"*  
   - *"Network unreachable"*  
   - DHCP not starting on boot  
   - Wi-Fi stuck at *"Obtaining IP"*
